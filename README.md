learning how to use python through web scraping


Script allows you to download manga from mangapanda.com

The script currently asks you for the name of the manga you want(this has to be exactly the same as on mangapanda), it also
asks you for the chapter you want to download.

I currently run this using python 2.7 and the script requires you to install 'beautifulsoup' and 'requests' libraries, which you can do using pip.
I will continue to update this as it is only the preliminary version and I have a couple of features I'm thinking of implementing. If you have any ideas or complaints throw up an issue on the project and i'll try and get to it.
